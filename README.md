# C++ Primer Plus Sixth Edition
Repository that holds material related to the book C++ Primer Plus Sixth Edition, by Stephen Prata. There are for example program listings and exercise solutions from the book.  

The listings are basically code taken from the book to test run while reading the book. Some small things have been changed in the listings but they should produce the same result as the listings in the book.  

The solutions to the exercises are all my own personal solutions.
