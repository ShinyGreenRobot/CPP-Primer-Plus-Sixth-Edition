## Question 1  
**What are the modules of C++ programs called?**  

The word module is not an official term but a C++ program can still conceptually be divided into modules in several different ways.  

A program is frequently divided into several separate source files that are compiled separatly and then linked togheter. Each such module is known as a translation unit.

Each source file is also generally divided into separate modules that are called functions.
