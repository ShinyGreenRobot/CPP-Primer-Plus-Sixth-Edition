#Chapter 1 Review  

## Question 1  
**What are the modules of C++ programs called?**  

The word module is not an official term but a C++ program can still conceptually be divided into modules in several different ways.  

A program is frequently divided into several separate source files that are compiled separately and then linked together. Each such module is known as a translation unit.  

Each source file is also generally divided into separate modules that are called functions.  

## Question 3
**What does the following preprocessor directive do?**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

This preprocessor directive will include the contents of the header file called iostream into the source file.
